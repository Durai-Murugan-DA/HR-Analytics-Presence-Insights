### Project Overview
---

This HR analytics project provides insights into employee presence, work-from-home (WFH) trends, and sick leave (SL) patterns. By analyzing attendance data, we aim to understand workforce presence percentages, identify trends, and recommend strategies to improve workforce management.

### Tools

- Excel - Data Cleaning
  - Used for preprocessing, handling missing values, and formatting data.
- Power BI - Data Visualization
  - Created interactive dashboards and reports for insights.
- Power Query - Data Transformation
  - Used for aggregating and transforming the data.
- DAX Functions - Data Analysis
  - Implemented calculated measures for deeper insights.

### Data Cleaning/Preparation

In the initial data preparation phase, we performed the following tasks:
1. Loaded and inspected the attendance dataset.
2. Handled missing values in presence, WFH, and SL fields.
3. Standardized date formats and employee records.

### Exploratory Data Analysis

Key questions addressed in the analysis:

- What is the overall presence percentage?
- What are the trends in work-from-home and sick leave?
- How do attendance patterns vary by day of the week?

### Data Analysis

Key insights derived from the data include:

- **Overall Presence Rate**: 91.86%
- **Work-from-Home Rate**: 9.88%
- **Sick Leave Rate**: 1.07%
- **Day-wise Presence Insights**:
  - Highest presence observed on Tuesdays (93.03%)
  - Lowest presence observed on Fridays (90.18%)
- **Work-from-Home Trends**:
  - Peaks observed on certain days, with a maximum of 23.44% in May 2022.

### Results/Findings

1. Employee presence remains consistently high, with minor fluctuations.
2. Work-from-home trends show occasional spikes, indicating flexible work policies.
3. Sick leave rates are minimal, but slightly higher on Mondays and Fridays.
4. Understanding day-wise trends can help optimize scheduling and workforce distribution.

### Recommendations

Based on the analysis, we recommend the following actions:
- Encourage in-office presence on lower-attendance days like Fridays.
- Monitor work-from-home spikes to ensure productivity remains unaffected.
- Consider flexible leave policies to address sick leave patterns effectively.
- Leverage attendance insights for better workforce planning and resource allocation.

### Limitations

- The analysis assumes accurate record-keeping of attendance data.
- External factors such as holidays or personal leaves are not explicitly considered.
